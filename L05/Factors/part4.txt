(a) How are the iterative and recursive algorithms similar and different for the same test cases?
Which has more repetition?
They run identically for many of the same numbers, however the iterative is generally slightly more efficient.
The recursive approach has more repetition.

(b) What is the most executed line in the iterative and recursive algorithms? Are they the same?
Recursive: Line 144 (In factor_rec())
Iterative: Line 242 (In factor_itr())
Not the same

(c) Are there any parts of the code which are not exercised?
Many, Iterative application will basically ignore all the recursion code and vice versa. However all the lines are executed in one or the other, with exception of printArray()

(d) If we were to try to optimize either function, where would be a good place to start?
Memoization for recursion or another solution inside of the for loops.
