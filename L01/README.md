# Introduction: Text Based Games

Text based games were all the rage in the 70’s/80’s, and retro gaming is in! These games where operated
entirely through Command Line Interfaces, no fancy graphics required. There were many text based
games, but one of the most popular was the Zork series (which you can play online for free http:
//textadventures.co.uk/games/view/5zyoqrsugeopel3ffhz_vq/zork). Give it a try some time!

# Activity: Let’s Play Terminus!
Terminus is a text based game, developed at MIT, designed to teach beginner commands (common to Unix shells). The game is freely available online at https://web.mit.edu/mprat/Public/web/Termi
nus/Web/main.html

NOTE read the instructions when you start the game carefully. They introduce the following commands:
• ls lists the contents of your current directory
• cd is used to move to a change directories (use cd .. to move backwards)
• less will print out the contents of a file
• pwd will show the file path of your parent working directory (i.e the directory you’re currently in)

# Objectives
1. Find All The Commands [10 pts]
- As you progress through the game, you’ll encounter new commands. Think of them like Pokemon
and try and catch them all!
– Make a list of all the commands you find with a short description of what they do. Save these
to a file named commands.txt, in the lab01 directory of your CS1XC3 repository. Commit
your work when complete.

2. Draw A Map of The Area [10 pts]
Graphviz is an extremely powerful tool for creating diagrams and flow charts. Let’s use it to make a map
of the locations in Terminus.
- You can get Graphvz here, or you can use the browser-based version here.
- Either way, create a full map of all the areas in Terminus, take a screenshot, and name it map.png. Trim the screen shot so that only the map is visible.
- Commit your map to your L01 repo directory.

3. Trivia Time! [6 pts]
Answer the following questions:
- Describe the differences between Linux and Windows (or MacOS) based on your own experience
with them so far.
- How many sign boards did you see on your way to Paradise?
